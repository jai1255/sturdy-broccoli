<h2>Security using colors and armstrong numners</h2>
<p> Generally we used cryptography      technique to secure the data. There are so many disadvantages with conventional cryptography techniques. In our project, we are used three set of keys for provide secure data transmission with the colors acting as vital security element thereby providing authentication. For color concept, we are used RGB format, arm strong numbers for data encryption. The sender assigns unique color for each user and this detail is stored in a database. The sender is aware of the required receiver to whom the data has to be sent..A set of three key values are added to the original color values and encrypted at the senderâ€™s side. This encrypted color actually acts as a password. The sender sends the key value to the receiver. The receiver is aware of the color assigned to him. The receiver decrypts the color by subtracting the key values from the encrypted color values. If the decrypted color value matches with the color value stored in the database, then the user is an authenticated user.  The ASCII code of original message added to arm strong numbers to obtain inverse matrix. After total data will send to receiver, there decryption process will be done.
